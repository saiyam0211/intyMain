FADD Studio,FADD Studio,"The world of design is in a constant state of flux; exploring and evolving into and out of new ideas, concept, trends and fads. It is also about revisiting older trends that were set decades ago and reinterpreting them in a fresh and contemporary way. So is the philosophy of FADD Studio. While FADD is an acronym for Farah and Dhaval Design, it is also a play on the word 'fad'.

It is easy to stagnate into a style that becomes a firm's identity. And we believe that having a singular style defies the purpose of design, which is to push beyond what we known, achieve something novel and unique in every project, and be constantly propelled out of our comfort zone into a world where we not only embrace new concepts and techniques but also create fads of our own. With this stubborn sensibility and desire to be original, we aspire not to create a style unique to us but to give you a design identity that is exclusive to you and your space whether it's a home, restaurant or store.

FADD Studio was founded in 2012 in Bangalore by Farah Ahmed, who studied at Istitutio Marangoni in Milan and Dhaval Shellugar who Studied at Rachana Sasand's Academy of Architecture and Design in Bombay. Both met while working at Khosla Associates under Sandeep Khosla and Amaresh Anand.
